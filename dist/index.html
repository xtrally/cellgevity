                    <h4>Impact of Oxidative Stress on Male Infertility</h4>
                    <p>Research has shown. 30-40% of male infertility is caused by OS.
                        OS can cause a decrease in the hormones that are responsible for sperm production (low sperm count) and appearance (immature/abnormal sperm)
                        OS can also damage the sperm, rendering them dormant/inactive. The sperm loses it's ability to swim to the egg in the woman (poor sperm quality). Thus the sperm lacks fertilization potential.</p>

        <h4>Little Interesting Story From Our User</h4>
            <p>From a Cellgevity user,
                I got married 2010 and in 2011 I was diagnosed with multiple fibroids.
                I was really afraid of surgery because people advised me against it. I have used so many supplements both made at home and abroad and none worked, that was the reason I didn't buy the idea of cellgevity when my friend told me about it.
                I did fibroid surgery in 2017, immediately after that I started praying to conceive, then in one of my praying sessions I heard a voice that said to me ''Try Cellgevity'' so immediately after the prayer I started reading more about cellgevity and after which I decided that I am going to give it a trial.
                God directed me to this Angel Mrs. Nkiruka Ezima who bought and sent cellgevity to me. I started taking cellgevity on 16th December while I was on my monthly cycle, and was confirmed pregnant on 15th of January this year after both private and NHS hospitals in UK told me that I can only conceive through IVF.
                Today I have a bouncing baby boy to call mine, what a mighty God we serve.
